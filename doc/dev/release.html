This documentation is defining every steps that needs to be accomplished when releasing IvyDE.
In this doc, the released version is denoted as $VERSION, so it HAVE to be replaced in the command line argument accordingly. There is also some $LOGIN which is referencing your login on the Apache machines.

<h1>Prepare</h1>

<h2>Jira</h2>

First in <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IVYDE">Jira</a> make sure that no more issues are opened for the target release.

<h2>Release branch</h2>

Some modifications of the branch are need to do the release. So a new branch is needed:
<pre>
svn copy https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ant/ivy/ivyde/trunk \
           https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ant/ivy/ivyde/branches/$VERSION \
      -m "Creating a release branch for IvyDE $VERSION"
</pre>

and then checkout it:
<pre>
svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ant/ivy/ivyde/branches/$VERSION ivyde-$VERSION
</pre>

<h2>Documentation release</h2>

The documentation have to specify the correct version number:
In the files:
<ul>
<li>doc/template.html</li>
</ul>
The header should look like this
<code>
<title>${title} | IvyDE $VERSION Documentation</title>
</code>

<h2>Release notes</h2>

TODO: some release notes exists in ivyde/trunk/org.apache.ivyde.eclipse/CHANGE.txt. Some work need to be done before they can be published on the website.

<h2>Commit your change</h2>

Don't forget to commit the changes you've done into the release branch.

<h1>Building</h1>

Make sure you have a proper working copy with a <tt>svn status</tt>. You should have no modification.

Then launch the build:
<pre>ant /release clean dist</pre>
And sign the artifacts:
<pre>./signArtifacts.sh</pre>

<h1>Prepare the updatesite</h1>

The instructions to build the updatesite are there:
http://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/latest-milestone/updatesite.html

<h1>Vote for the released artifacts</h1>

It is recommended to publish the distribution artifacts and the updatesite in your public_html on people.apache.org directory so not only committers can test it.

On people.apache.org, create your "staging" directory:
<pre>mkdir ~/public_html/ivyde-$VERSION/</pre>
And then the copy:
<pre>scp dist/* $LOGIN@people.apache.org:/home/$LOGIN/public_html/ivyde-$VERSION/</pre>
It is recommended to also deploy a staging updatesite there. See <a href="http://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/latest-milestone/updatesite.html">that page</a> to know how to proceed.

And launch the vote on the ant-dev mailing list:
<code>
Subject: [VOTE] IvyDE $VERSION Release

I have built a release candidate for IvyDE $VERSION

You can download the distribution from this URL: http://people.apache.org/~$LOGIN/ivyde-$VERSION/

And a staging update site has been setup there: http://people.apache.org/~$LOGIN/staging-updatesite

Do you vote for the release of these binaries?

[ ] Yes
[ ] No

Regards,

$ME, IvyDE $VERSION release manager
</code>

Note: this <a href="http://ant.apache.org/bylaws.html">page</a> is defining when and how a release can be accepted.

<h1>The release has been accepted</h1>

Then it is time to tag the release:
<code>svn copy https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ant/ivy/ivyde/branches/$VERSION \
           https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ant/ivy/ivyde/tags/$VERSION \
      -m "Tag IvyDE release $VERSION"
</code>

<h1>Deployment</h1>

<h2>Publish the artifacts</h2>

The binaries have to be pushed with their signatures and checksums in the apache dist directory. On people.apache.org:
<pre>
mkdir /www/www.apache.org/dist/ant/ivyde/$VERSION
cp /home/$LOGIN/public_html/ivyde-$VERSION/* $LOGIN@people.apache.org:/www/www.apache.org/dist/ant/ivyde/$VERSION
</pre>

<h2>Deploy the updatesite</h2>

Follow the instructions of that page: http://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/latest-milestone/updatesite.html

<h1>Update the documentation</h1>

The table of content needs to be updated so that the last documentation point to that new release.

First we need to update the external links. In svn/site/ivyde/history:
<pre>svn pe svn:externals .</pre>
And: <ul><li>update latest-milestone:
<code>
latest-milestone https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ant/ivy/ivyde/tags/$VERSION/doc </code>
</li>
<li>add an entry:
<code>$VERSION https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ant/ivy/ivyde/tags/$VERSION/doc </code></li>
</ul>

Then we need to edit svn/site/ivyde/toc.json:
<ul>
<li>add the following data to the correct abstract node:
<pre>
            {
                "title":"$VERSION",
                "importRoot":"history/$VERSION",
                "importNode":"index"
            }
</pre>
</li>
<li>update the title of the latest-milestone history entry:
<pre>
            "title":"Documentation ($VERSION)"
</pre>
</li></ul>

<h1>Post release tasks</h1>

<h2>Jira</h2>

Update the <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/project/ManageVersions.jspa?pid=12310640">IvyDE Jira project</a>: mark the version as released.

<h2>Bump the version</h2>

Update the versions needs to be updated in the following files:
<ul>
<li>build.properties (edit the qualifier)</li>
<li>org.apache.ivyde.eclipse/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</li>
<li>org.apache.ivyde.feature/feature.xml</li>
</ul>
</textarea>
<script type="text/javascript">xooki.postProcess();</script>
</body>
</html>

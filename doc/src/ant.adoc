Most Eclipse(TM) distributions include a plugin to launch Apache Ant build files. The provided Apache Ant distribution is a standard distribution of Ant that doesn't include Apache Ivy. You may wish to run Ivy targets against Eclipse's Ant distribution.

== Install the plugin

Since IvyDE 2.2, a dedicated plugin can be install so that Ivy Ant tasks are automatically added to Ant's classpath. Go check the IvyDE updatesite and install the plugin named "Apache Ivy Ant Tasks"

== Manual Configuration

If you want to install your custom version of Ivy, you'll need to do it manually.

In the global preference page of the Ant runtime, click on *Add External JARs...*

Then browse your filesystem to the `plugins` directory of your Eclipse installation and select the Ivy jar named `org.apache.ivy_2.X.X.XXXXXXXXX.jar`. Now Ivy has been added to the classpath of the Ant distribution embedded in Eclipse.

== Run Apache Ivy targets

Create an Ant build file and declare the Ivy targets with:

[source]
----
    <taskdef resource="org/apache/ivy/ant/antlib.xml" uri="antlib:org.apache.ivy.ant" />
----

And don't forgot to declare the namespace `xmlns:ivy="antlib:org.apache.ivy.ant"`.

After the taskdefs have been added, you will have code completion on Ivy tasks:

The build will now be successful:

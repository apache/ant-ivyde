During the life of your project, you can change the `ivy.xml` file or link:maven{outfilesuffix}[Maven `pom.xml`] and change its configuration.

== Context Menu

These properties can be accessed by the context menu of the IvyDE classpath container:

== Build Path

You can also edit it via the *build path* configuration:

. open the build path configuration dialog, select the "Libraries" panel and select the IvyDE classpath container.
. then click on the "Edit" button: the IvyDE classpath container configuration dialog will pop up.

This is particularly useful when Eclipse hides the empty classpath containers (since Eclipse 3.3).  When the container is empty, this is the only way to trigger a resolve on this project.

If you want to use a Apache Maven(TM) `pom.xml` instead of an `ivy.xml` file, you can select a POM file in the configuration options of the IvyDE classpath.

When a Maven POM is selected, the configurations list is updated with all Maven scopes.

Both examples below are a good illustration of the simplicity of using Maven POMs in Apache IvyDE:

* link:#one[Maven1 sample]
* link:#two[Maven2 sample]

== [[one]]Maven1 Sample

This sample presents a simple use case involving a Maven POM and the IvyDE classpath container. We are going to create an Eclipse(TM) project on commons-httpclient sources.

* Download the link:https://archive.apache.org/dist/httpcomponents/commons-httpclient/3.0/source/commons-httpclient-3.0-src.zip[commons httpclient sources]

* Unzip this file (c:/tmp/commons-httpclient/)

* Create a new Eclipse Java project based on the unzipped sources (c:/tmp/commons-httpclient/)

*Note:* your project will not compile: some imports cannot be resolved.

* Add a new classpath container based on the "project.xml" POM and select "default" configuration (Maven scope)

* Finished.  The project compiles!

== [[two]]Maven2 Sample

This sample demonstrates how the IvyDE classpath container on a Apache Maven POM can handle transitive dependencies.

* Create a new empty Java project in Eclipse.

* In your project, create an `ivysettings.xml` file:

[source]
----
<ivysettings>
	<conf defaultResolver="ibiblio"/>
	<resolvers>
		<ibiblio name="ibiblio" />
	</resolvers>
</ivysettings>
----

Using the `m2compatible` attribute, you can benefit from Apache Maven 2 repository compatibility.

* In your project, create a `pom.xml` file:

[source]
----
<project>
	<modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
	<groupId>com.mycompany</groupId>
	<artifactId>myproject</artifactId>
	<version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>commons-httpclient</groupId>
			<artifactId>commons-httpclient</artifactId>
			<version>3.0</version>
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>
</project>
----

* On the `pom.xml` file, open the context menu and click on "Add Ivy Library...":

* Select the configurations `compile` and `runtime`

* click "Finish"

* That's all! Your IvyDE classpath container resolves all dependencies including those that were transitive to the commons-httpclient module!

You can explicitly ask for Ivy dependency resolution from your classpath container.

This command will invoke the "resolve" Ivy task and update your classpath container.

There is also a "refresh" action: this action is similar to the resolve one, but does not perform a full resolve if a report already exists in the cache. This is particularly useful if you work with Apache Ant and a command line so that you avoid two full resolves.  It is also the default action performed on classpath containers when the Eclipse workspace is opened (*Windows > Preferences > Ivy*), in effect restoring the classpath container to its state prior to the last closing of the workspace if no other action is performed against the `ivy.xml` file in the meantime.

And there is a "reload settings" action: by default IvyDE does reload Ivy settings files each time a resolve it required. But in case the ivy settings file is remote, this take make the user experience quite slow. To work around that, you can check in the link:../preferences{outfilesuffix}[preference page] the option to only load on demand, and use the "reload settings" action in the context menu.

== Full Refresh

You can also trigger a resolve (not a refresh!) of every IvyDE classpath container in the workspace via the button in the tool bar of Eclipse.

== Project Refresh

To launch a resolve on a specified selection of projects:

* Select the projects you want to resolve in the package view,
* Open the context menu with a right click
* Choose *Ivy > Resolve*

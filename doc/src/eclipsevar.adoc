Eclipse contains a link:https://help.eclipse.org/galileo/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference/preferences/run-debug/ref-string_substitution.htm[string substitution mechanism]. This feature allows you to specify a path location that can be shared between developers.

Apache IvyDE uses it to find the ivysettings.xml and properties files in both the link:preferences{outfilesuffix}#settings[global preference page] and the link:cpc/create{outfilesuffix}#localconf[project specific preference page].

== Options

Using the "Workspace..." button will open a window to choose a file in the workspace. Apache IvyDE will automatically fill the field with the proper variable.

Using the "File System..." button will allow you to choose a file in the file system. This path will not be portable.

Finally, you can choose to depend on the Eclipse variable system by clicking on "Variable...".

== Backwards compatibility

Previously, Apache IvyDE supported the `project://projectName/path/to/file.ext` protocol. It sill does, but references of this style will be automatically converted in the saved settings to the Eclipse variable way of defining this path: `${workspace_loc:projectName/path/to/file.ext}.`
